This is a class project of Minying Lu and Chelsea Waida on Twitter Sentiment Analysis

###Project update: 4/1 Happy April Fools day :p

**Minying**
- get /follower/list of the 20ish users (3 and -4), find the users that are following the popular users and also in our dataframe(5000) and compare the polarity scores
  - if we can't find the following relationships we can search the whole dataset
  - maybe geo

**Chelsea**
- popularity is defined by # of retweets + favorites
- for each tweet, get urls: T/F from eneities
- for each tweet, get list of mentioned users (id? name?)
- history gram for things:
  - urls vs popularity & polarity
  - mentioned vs popularity & polarity
